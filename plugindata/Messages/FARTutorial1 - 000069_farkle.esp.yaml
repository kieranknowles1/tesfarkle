    How to play:


    At the beginning of a round, players throw all six dice at once.

    After each throw, you must set aside and score one or more die, then bank or throw the remaining dice.

    If you score all six dice in a round, you may rethrow all six again.

    If you are unable to score from a throw, you are bust and lose all unbanked points.

    The game continues until either player reaches the target score.
